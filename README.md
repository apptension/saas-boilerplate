## Getting started

### Requirements

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker)
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`).
  You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [n](https://github.com/tj/n) for managing multiple Node versions installed on a single machine.
- Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) version 9 or above (which can be checked by running `pnpm --version`)
- (Windows only) Install [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

#### Optional

- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.11 (which can be checked by running `python3 --version`) and [PDM](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/#installation) version 2.3 or above (which can be checked by running
  `pdm --version`)
  - You need this one if you want to run `pdm install` command in `packages/backend` or `packages/workers` outside
    docker container
  - You can use [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for managing multiple Python versions installed on a single machine.

### Fresh installation

#### Setup using CLI starter kit

You can use a special CLI tool to run a new local instance of the SaaS Boilerplate as soon as possible. It will clone
the repository and take care of setting up the environment. Run the following command in the directory where you would
like to create a new project:

**_Using `npm`:_**

```bash
npm init saas-boilerplate PATH
```

**_Using `pnpm`:_**

```bash
pnpm create saas-boilerplate PATH
```

**_Using `yarn`:_**

```bash
yarn create saas-boilerplate PATH
```

> :information_source: Where `PATH` is a directory name where to initialize project.
>
> :warning: **The init directory needs to be empty!**

#### Manual setup

For the manual setup clone this repository and follow the steps in
[Getting started guide](https://docs.demo.saas.apptoku.com/getting-started/run-project/run-new-project#manual-setup).

### Run existing project

> :warning: **If you are using a Windows machine**, it's mandatory to have **WSL 2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
> installed on your system to run the commands for installing dependencies and running the application.

#### Install dependencies

The project is configured to use pnpm workspaces, which means that you can install `node_modules` of all packages in
repository, with single command:

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Start the app

Start both: backend and webapp

```sh
pnpm saas up
```

#### Start backend

```sh
pnpm saas backend up
```

#### Start webapp

```sh
pnpm saas webapp up
```

#### Local documentation

In order to run your local documentation server execute following command:

```sh
pnpm saas docs up
```

## How was the SaaS Boilerplate created?

In our experience in Apptension, we have built hundreds of web and mobile applications over the years and saw a bunch of standard features. For example, all applications (or at least 99% of them) need a login, email templating, payments and subscriptions, CMS integration, and more.

A broader list of elements that can be implemented in projects in this way was created after building dozens of different types of SaaS products. We analyzed them and noticed many common parts appeared virtually unchanged. So we created SaaS Boilerplate that is the base, and while it requires design or functional customization for a specific SaaS product, it dramatically reduces development time.

That's why you don't have to start by writing the code for that login or payment function. Instead, you can use off-the-shelf elements in those places and focus on creating the rest of the features unique to the project.

The development process is ongoing as we continually add new features and improve existing ones. We started with AWS Boilerplate, which evolved into the current SaaS Boilerplate. It originally contained only infrastructure (a configured AWS account) and was a template for the project, which had blanks for the back-end and front-end.

We saw that it was already a handy and very well-received tool, so the next natural step was to add more elements to it ‚Äì front-end, back-end, and pack the relevant features that were most often repeated in different projects, including logging, CRUD, payments, integration with content pool, etc.

Our idea was that it shouldn't be just the code itself because SaaS Boilerplate also contains our know-how ‚Äì because we gathered everything needed for development and around development in one package. So you don't have to think about choosing code formatting, matching different tools and their subsequent configuration, etc. Moreover, such a package is proven and battle-tested ‚Äì you can just upload it to the cloud and start so-called heavy development.

## Who are we?

We're [Apptension](https://apptension.com?utm_source=readme-file&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=SaaS%20Boilerplate&utm_term=SaaS%20Boilerplate), a team that turns ideas into world-class software using expertise in technology, design, and product management. We work with founders, investors, and creative agencies to help them bring uncommon ideas to the market.

Our partners value our outside-the-box thinking, clear and honest communication, and reliability ‚Äì even in the most dynamic and time-compressed projects. Among our clients ‚Äì plenty of early-stage startups, as well as international tech behemoths like Netflix and Uber. We live and breathe tech ‚Äì and we're darn good at it.

To bring even more value to our partners, we create bespoke tools (like SaaS Boilerplate), allowing us to shorten time-to-market while avoiding technical debt.
