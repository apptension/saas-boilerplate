# Shadcn/ui Components

[Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) is a collection of re-usable components built using
[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
In <ProjectName />, these components are centrally managed in the `webapp-core` package under the `components/ui`
directory.

## Using Existing Components

All shadcn/ui components are available in the `webapp-core` package. You can import them directly in your components
like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@sb/webapp-core/components/ui/button';
```

## Adding New Components

To add a new component from the shadcn/ui library, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the webapp-core package:

   ```bash
   cd packages/webapp-core
   ```

2. Use the shadcn CLI to add the desired component:

   :::warning
   You must use version 2.1.6 of the CLI as newer versions have compatibility issues with alias resolution
   ([see GitHub issue](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/issues/6048)):

   ```tsx
   pnpm dlx shadcn@2.1.6 add {component_name}
   ```

   :::

   For example, to add the calendar component:

   ```bash
   pnpm dlx shadcn@2.1.6 add calendar
   ```

3. The component will be automatically added to the `components/ui` directory in the `webapp-core` package.

4. You can now import and use the component in any part of your application:
   ```tsx
   import { Calendar } from '@sb/webapp-core/components/ui/calendar';
   ```

## Component Customization

All components can be customized using Tailwind CSS classes. For detailed information about component customization and
available props, refer to the [official shadcn/ui documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).
