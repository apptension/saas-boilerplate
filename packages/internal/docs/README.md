# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```console
pnpm i -w
```

## Local Development

```console
pnpm nx run docs:start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without
having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
pnpm nx run docs:build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting
service.
